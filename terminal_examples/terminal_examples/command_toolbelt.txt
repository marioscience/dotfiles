TODO: Apps that might be nice to implement under /code
- create a different user to work on projects. another for personal stuff. 
- create a notepad command that will save everything that you type in the prompt provided. The idea is to capture user input really fast to take quick notes that can be parsed and organized. The store for the test will work as a queue holding all lines typed with a finite capacity but large notheless. Say a notepad that will hold a buffer of 1MB de texto y cualquier linea que llegue al fondo del queue it will get deleted. 
- create dashboard to display at startup in command line. there is also a file related to this and some comments in i3 config file. 
Legend: []: not done [ ]:in progress [x]: done
