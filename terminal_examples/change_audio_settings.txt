When headphones are connected with bluetooth there's a (virtual?) card 
added in pulse audio. 

use 'pulseaudio --start' to start pulse audio demon
use bluetoothctl tool to start bluetooth and connect. In the prompt 
there is a 'help' command use it to be able to power on bluetooth, start 
an agent, scan devices, pair and connect. 

There is a script in /etc/X11/Xsession.d (should be called 100autoconnect-bluetooth-headphones)
that gets run every time an x session is started (startx is run). This script
connects the headphones right away. (In the future we could get the alias working, but
it is using the MAC of the headhpones (Sennheiser 4.50btnc))

use command pulseaudio -v, -k, --start to get log, kill and start 
audiopulse daemon. Audiopulse is added between the hardware and the 
audio, but it's not really a driver but used for multiplexing mainly.


use blueman-applet to bring up a nice window (and little icon in the
bar) to chane bluetooth and audio settings

use pactl to control pulse audio using commands

# lists a list of audio cards in the system
pactl list cards <short>

# set a profile using the id and the name of the profile
pactl set-card-profile 1 a2dp
